# Tailwind CSS Quick reference

-   the `data.json` containing the sections need to be manually updated, otherwise the program would need to filter out links that I dont need.
-   `tooltips.json` can be scraped with the `npm rebuild.js` node script. it will load the links from data.json and fetch the page, extract the table and put it into a nice json format for later.

## how to run

the program is scaffolded with vite, after cloning run
```
npm install
npm dev```
this will start up a dev server and give you the link. you can also find the live version in the description
